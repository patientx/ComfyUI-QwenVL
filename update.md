# Release Notes: v2.3.0 (2026-08-26)

### 🎬 Intelligent Adaptive Video Scaling & Safe Token Budget
<img width="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df99ea79-89dc-4bd9-a971-f7df33c9fa50" />

- **Dynamic Context Budget Estimation**:
  - Automatically calculates safe per-frame token budget based on the model's active context window (`ctx`) and sampled frame count (`frame_count`).
  - Completely resolves `decode: failed to find a memory slot for batch` errors in GGUF/llama.cpp and CUDA OOM (Out Of Memory) in Transformers backends.
- **Smart Resolution Decision**:
  - **Low/Medium Resolution Videos**: If the native dimensions fit within the token budget, the original resolution is preserved without unnecessary downscaling or quality loss.
  - **High Resolution Videos (1080p / 4K)**: Automatically downscales video frames using high-quality bicubic interpolation to fit safely within the token allocation, printing informative status logs.
- **New `video_frame_size` Parameter**:
  - Added `video_frame_size` option to all Advanced nodes (`AILab_QwenVL_GGUF_Advanced` and `AILab_QwenVL_Advanced`) supporting `"auto"`, `"384"`, `"448"`, `"512"`, `"768"`, and `"original"`.
  - Standard/Basic nodes automatically apply intelligent auto-scaling for a seamless out-of-the-box experience.

### 📦 Unified & Simplified Custom Models Architecture (`custom_models.json`)
- **Streamlined 2-Section Design**: Consolidated model configuration into two clean sections:
  - `hf_models`: All HuggingFace / Transformers models (used by both VL and text nodes).
  - `gguf_models`: All GGUF models (used by vision nodes with `mmproj_file`, and text nodes like Prompt Enhancer which safely ignores `mmproj_file`).
- **Full GGUF Custom Catalog Support**:
  - `AILab_QwenVL_GGUF` and `AILab_QwenVL_GGUF_Advanced` dynamically load custom vision GGUF models (`gguf_models`).
  - `AILab_QwenVL_GGUF_PromptEnhancer` dynamically loads custom text GGUF models (`gguf_models`).
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fully preserves backward compatibility for legacy split sections (`hf_vl_models`, `hf_text_models`, `gguf_vl_models`, `gguf_text_models`, `qwenVL_model`, `Qwen_model`).
- **Updated Documentation**: Added detailed guides in [`docs/custom_models.md`](./docs/custom_models.md) and [`custom_models_example.json`](./custom_models_example.json).

### 📥 Enhanced HuggingFace Downloader (`AILab_HuggingFaceDownloader`)
<img width="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7857b525-9dd9-4b7e-9425-f9c1aa7bccf2" />

- **Fixed Standalone Execution**: Added `OUTPUT_NODE = True` so the downloader runs independently in workflows without triggering `[WARNING] invalid prompt: {'type': 'prompt_no_outputs'}`.
- **Smart `mmproj` Auto-Discovery & Download**:
  - Automatically queries the HuggingFace repository to identify and download matching `mmproj*.gguf` visual projector files (prioritizing `F16`/`BF16`).
  - Added optional `mmproj_filename` input for users who want to specify a custom/specific projector file.
- **Smart Auto-Routing (`save_folder: "auto"`)**:
  - `save_folder` now defaults to `"auto"`. The downloader automatically inspects the model type and routes GGUF models directly to `models/LLM/GGUF/{author}/{repo_name}/` and Transformers models to `models/LLM/hf/{author}/{repo_name}/`, preventing manual folder misconfiguration.
- **Clean UI with `model_info` Output**:
  - Exposes `model_info` output pin (`RETURN_TYPES = ("STRING",)`) allowing downstream workflows to capture the summary text if desired.
  - Automatically renders a rich, color-coded HTML status card directly inside the node's UI (`web/js/downloader.js`) featuring bold titles, colored labels, status badges, syntax-highlighted registration JSON, dynamic auto-expansion on execution, and responsive flexbox resizing.

### 🔌 Modular Inference Engine & CLI (`qwenvl_engine.py` & `qwenvl_cli.py`)
- **Cross-Plugin Ecosystem Support**: Exposes `is_qwenvl_available()`, `run_qwenvl_vision()`, and `run_qwenvl_text()` for seamless zero-friction integration with external scripts and custom node packages.
- **Standalone CLI**: Added `qwenvl_cli.py` for direct command-line inference and status inspection.

### 🛠️ Codebase Optimization & Centralized Media Utilities (`AILab_Utils.py`)
- **Shared Vision & Video Utilities**: Consolidated tensor-to-PIL conversion, Base64 encoding, uniform video frame sampling, and dynamic budget estimation into a unified [`AILab_Utils.py`](./py/AILab_Utils.py) module.
- **Dynamic Input Validation**: Added dynamic `VALIDATE_INPUTS` across all nodes so newly added/downloaded models pass ComfyUI prompt validation without restart.
- **Cleaned Deprecations**: Removed deprecated fallback chains and legacy references to `custom_gguf_models.json`.

# Release Notes: v2.2.0 (2026-08-20)

### 🌟 Qwen3.5, Qwen3.6 (MoE) & Qwen3.8 Native GGUF Support
- **Expanded Model Catalog**: Added direct support for Qwen3.5-VL-7B, Qwen3.6-VL-MoE, and Qwen3.8-VL-14B within the GGUF nodes.
- **Native Memory Management**: Implemented `comfy.model_management` to gracefully handle cache clearing (`soft_empty_cache` and `unload_all_models`) directly within the ComfyUI ecosystem, eliminating VRAM leaks when models are unloaded.
- **Simplified Installation Guide**: Updated `llama-cpp-python` dependency to `>=0.3.40` which natively supports all new vision chat handlers and MoE offloading without complex version matrices. Added clear console warnings pointing users to `docs/LLAMA_CPP_PYTHON_VISION_INSTALL.md` if the vision bindings are missing.

### 🛠️ Feature Additions & Bug Fixes
- **VRAM Leak Fix (Issue https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-QwenVL/issues/182)**: Fixed a critical issue where VRAM was not released after inference when `keep_model_loaded=False`. The GGUF nodes now explicitly call `self.llm.close()` to free the GGML C++ backend memory, and the Transformer nodes now properly clear `torch._dynamo` cache and force PyTorch garbage collection.
- **New HuggingFace Downloader Node**: Added `AILab_HuggingFaceDownloader` to allow users to directly download GGUF/HF models or entire repositories from HuggingFace directly into ComfyUI's model directories.
- **Prompt Enhancer Fix (PR #179)**: Fixed a critical bug in `AILab_QwenVL_PromptEnhancer` (Transformers) where instruct models (like Qwen3-4B) would ignore system instructions and act as text-continuations. The node now correctly applies the tokenizer's chat template (`apply_chat_template`).
- **GGUF Prompt Enhancer Optimization**: Removed hardcoded `"chat_format": "qwen"` in `AILab_QwenVL_GGUF_PromptEnhancer.py`. The node now dynamically reads the native chat template embedded directly within the GGUF file (e.g., ChatML for Qwen3), ensuring perfect special-token formatting for newer architectures.

### Enhanced GPU Device Selection (Advanced Node)
The **QwenVL (Advanced)** node now offers flexible GPU device management:

- **Manual GPU selection** — Choose specific CUDA devices (e.g., `cuda:1`, `cuda:2`) instead of defaulting to `cuda:0`
- **Automatic device detection** — Dynamically discovers all available CUDA devices on your system
- **Improved device mapping** — More consistent behavior and better resource allocation
- **OOM prevention** — Route models to underutilized GPUs when your primary GPU is handling diffusion workloads

*Note: The basic QwenVL node continues to use automatic device selection for simplicity*

⚡ Major Performance Optimization Update

This release introduces a full rework of the QwenVL runtime to significantly improve speed, stability, and GPU utilization.

![QwenVL_V1.1.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13e89746-a04e-41a3-9026-7079b29e149c)

### 🚀 Core Improvements
- **Flash Attention Integration (Auto Detection)**  
  Automatically leverages next-generation attention optimization for faster inference on supported GPUs, while falling back to SDPA when needed.
- **Attention Mode Selector**  
  Both QwenVL nodes expose the attention backend (auto / flash_attention_2 / sdpa) so users can quickly validate which mode performs best on their hardware without leaving the basic workflow view.
- **Precision Optimization**  
  Smarter internal precision handling improves throughput and keeps performance consistent across high-end and low-VRAM cards.
- **Runtime Acceleration**  
  The execution pipeline now keeps KV cache/device alignment always-on, cutting per-run overhead and reducing latency.
- **Caching System**  
  Models remain cached in memory between runs, drastically lowering reload times when prompts change.
- **Video Frame Optimization**  
  Streamlined frame sampling and preprocessing accelerate video-focused workflows.
- **Hardware Adaptation**  
  Smarter device detection ensures the best configuration across NVIDIA GPUs, Apple Silicon, and CPU fallback scenarios.

### 🧠 Developer Enhancements
- Unified model and processor loading with cleaner logging and fewer bottlenecks.  
- Refined quantization and memory handling for better stability across quant modes.  
- Improved fallback behavior when advanced GPU optimizations are unavailable.

### 💡 Compatibility
- Fully backward compatible with existing ComfyUI workflows.  
- Retains both **QwenVL** and **QwenVL (Advanced)** nodes: the basic node now bundles the most useful speed controls, while the advanced node exposes every knob (quantization, attention, device, torch.compile) for deep tuning.

### 🔧 Recommended
- PyTorch ≥ 2.8.0  
- CUDA 12.4 or later  
- Flash Attention 2.x (optional, for maximum performance)

> Switching quantization or attention modes forces a one-time model reload and is expected behavior when comparing runtime profiles.
### Version 1.0.4 (2025/10/31)

🆕 **Custom Model Support Added**
- Users can now add their own **custom Qwen-VL or Hugging Face models**
